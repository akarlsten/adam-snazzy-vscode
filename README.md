A VS Code theme based on [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) and [vscode-snazzy-operator](https://github.com/aaronthomas/vscode-snazzy-operator).

Changes compared to Aaron Thomas version are:

- Theming for every part of the UI. If I missed anything let me know!
- A darker yellow color (taken from Dracula, i think) as the pale yellow in the original didn't appeal to me.
- Alternate version with **_italics_** for keywords like "this" and "class" for use with Operator/Dank Mono.
- Alternate **darker version** that I've started preferring on my brighter laptop screen.

Feel free to open a Github issue for any comments/suggestions.
