# VS Code Snazzy Operator - akarlsten version

[![](http://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/aaronthomas.vscode-snazzy-operator.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/aaronthomas.vscode-snazzy-operator)

A VS Code theme based on [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy). Changes compared to Aaron Thomas version are a darker yellow color (taken from Dracula, i think) as the pale yellow in the original didn't appeal. Also removed the italicized keywords for stuff like "this" as I don't use Operator Mono.
